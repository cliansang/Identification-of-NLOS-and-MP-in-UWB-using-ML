Labels are classified as follows:
LOS ==1; 
NLOS == 2; 
MP == 3;
where, LOS (Line-of-Sight), NLOS (Non-Line-of-Sight), and MP (Multi-path) conditions.

The 12 features mentioned in the paper were recorded in the experimental research data as follows:
1. the reported measured distance : << Dist >>
2.  the compound amplitudes of multiple harmonics in the FP signal : << FP >>
3. the amplitude of the first harmonic in the FP signal : << FPAmp1 >>
4. the amplitude of the second harmonic in the FP signal : << FPAmp2 >>
5. the amplitude of the third harmonic in the FP signal : << FPAmp3 >>
6. the amplitude of the channel impulse response (CIR) : << CIR >>
7. the standard noise reported in DW1000 chip module : << stdN >>
8. the maximum noise reported in DW1000 chip module : << maxN >>
9. the preamble accumulation count reported in DW1000 chip module : << preamCnt >>
10. the estimated RX power level : << RSS_CIR >>
11. the estimated FP power level : << RSS_FP >>
12. the difference between the FP and RX power level  : << powerDiff >>
13: the Labels defined above : << LOS or NLOS or MP >>
